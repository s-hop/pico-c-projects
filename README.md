# pico-c-projects
## A collection of Raspberry Pi Pico projects written in C, using the RPi C/C++ SDK.

This repository is meant to serve as a place where I can store the projects I work on while I study C and embedded systems with the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. If you intend to use any of this code in your own projects, please keep in mind my limited knowledge of both subjects. There are almost certainly bugs and/or code smells throughout. Criticism is welcomed and encouraged!
